                    <h2>How to Solve the Rubik's Cube</h2>
                    <p>If you've ever wondered how to solve the Rubik's Cube, you're not alone. It may seem daunting at first, but with the right method and practice, you can master it. There are various solving methods, with the most popular one being the CFOP method:</p>
                    <ul class="cfop-list">
                        <li><strong>Cross:</strong> Start by solving the cross on one face.</li>
                        <li><strong>F2L (First Two Layers):</strong> Solve the first two layers simultaneously.</li>
                        <li><strong>OLL (Orientation of Last Layer):</strong> Orient the pieces in the last layer.</li>
                        <li><strong>PLL (Permutation of Last Layer):</strong> Permute the pieces in the last layer to complete the cube.</li>
                    </ul>
